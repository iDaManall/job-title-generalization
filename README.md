## Overview

This project is part of the AI Studio 2024 Challenge in collaboration with **Candogram Inc.**, a leading provider of job market education. The goal is to analyze and classify job postings with the word "engineer" in their titles to create meaningful job title clusters and visualize these clusters effectively. This is my version of the project, my peers also have their own iterations which you should check out too!

### Key Objectives

- Analyze ~20,000 job postings containing the word "engineer."
- Group job titles into clusters (e.g., software engineer, civil engineer) using natural language processing (NLP) and clustering techniques.
- Provide a scatterplot visualization of the clusters and assign job titles to each cluster.

## Dataset

The dataset contains **20,138 job postings** in a CSV format with the following fields:

- `RequisitionID`
- `OrigJobTitle`
- `JobTitle`
- `JobDescription`

ðŸ“¥ [Download the dataset](https://candogram-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/Engineer_20230826.zip)

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Remove HTML tags** from job descriptions.
2. **Isolate job description text** from other sections of the postings.
3. Convert job descriptions into embeddings for clustering.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Remove HTML code from job postings.
  - Extract relevant job description sentences (marketing, requirements, legal, etc.).

- **Vectorization:**
  - Convert job descriptions into vectors using techniques like **FastText** or similar.

- **Clustering Algorithms:**
  - Apply **KMeans** and **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for clustering.

### Key Tools and Libraries

- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Python Virtual Environment
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, matplotlib, pyLDAvis, FastText, GPT-4o mini API
